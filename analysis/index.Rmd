# The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviour: a living systematic review

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread morbidity and mortality as well as disruption to people’s lives and livelihoods around the world. 
There are concerns that rates of suicide, suicidal behaviours and self-harm may rise during and in the aftermath of the pandemic – with particular concerns around the impact of lockdown, economic recession and service disruption as well as high risk groups such as older people, people with [pre-existing mental illness and children and young people](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30171-1/fulltext). 

Given the likely rapidly expanding research evidence base on the pandemic’s impact on rates of suicide, suicidal behaviours and self-harm and emerging evidence about how best to mitigate such effects, it is important that the best available knowledge is made readily available to policymakers, public health specialists and clinicians as soon as is possible. To facilitate this, we are conducting a living systematic review focusing on [suicide prevention in relation to COVID-19](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=183326). 

Daily automated searches will feed into a web-based screening system. Following initial screening, articles will be reviewed daily by suicide prevention experts in our team. Key publications and evidence summaries will be shared with policy makers in the UK, Ireland and Internationally. Our eligibility criteria are wide and include aspects of incidence and prevalence of suicidal behaviour, effects of exposures, modelling studies and effects of interventions to mitigate the impact of pandemic on suicidal behaviour. The published version of the review will be updated at three-monthly intervals if a sufficient volume of new evidence justifies doing so.


Please see the ["Results"](results.html) tab to view a summary of the current evidence.
