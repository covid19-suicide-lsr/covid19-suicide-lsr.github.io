Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable morbidity, mortality and disruption to peopleâ€™s lives around the world. There are concerns that rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour may rise during and in its aftermath. Our living systematic review synthesises findings from emerging literature on incidence and prevalence of suicidal behaviour as well as suicide prevention efforts in relation to COVID-19, with this iteration synthesising relevant evidence up to 19th October 2020.

Method:  Automated daily searches feed into a web-based database with screening and data extraction functionalities. Eligibility criteria include incidence/prevalence of suicidal behaviour, exposure-outcome relationships and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest are suicide, self-harm or attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts. No restrictions are placed on language or study type, except for single-person case reports. We exclude one-off cross-sectional studies without either pre-pandemic measures or comparisons of COVID-19 positive vs. unaffected individuals.

Results: Searches identified 6,226 articles. Seventy-eight articles met our inclusion criteria. We identified a further 64 relevant cross-sectional studies that did not meet our revised inclusion criteria. Thirty-four articles were not peer-reviewed (e.g. research letters, pre-prints). All articles were based on observational studies.
There was no consistent evidence of a rise in suicide but many studies noted adverse economic effects were evolving. There was evidence of a rise in community distress, fall in hospital presentation for suicidal behaviour and early evidence of an increased frequency of suicidal thoughts in those who had become infected with COVID-19.

Conclusions:  Research evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviour is accumulating rapidly. This living review provides a regular synthesis of the most up-to-date research evidence to guide public health and clinical policy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide risk as the longer term impacts of the pandemic on suicide risk are researched. 

## Living review updates
We continue our daily reference retrieval and monitoring of relevant publications. The figures below are visualisations of the current, living state of our database. These results are updated regularly and include unpublished and non-peer-reviewed information. For an overview of current publications, please see the tab 'Publications' on this website. 

This figure shows the papers we included after fulltext screening. The figure is broken down by data source, showing contributions from databases, pre-print servers, and COVID-specific sources across our review's life-span.

This plot shows outcomes discussed in our included papers.This living review evolved in parallel to the pandemic, thus leading to changes in inclusion criteria that affect study types and outcomes during the past years. Please refer to the website section 'Publications' for more information.
